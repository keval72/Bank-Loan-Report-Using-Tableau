## PROJECT NAME:

#### BANK LOAN REPORT: A Complete Bank Loan Report Project using SQL & Tableau

## ABOUT PROJECT:

Bank Loan Report project provides a detailed analysis of bank loan data, enabling financial analysts, loan officers, and business leaders to monitor loan performance, assess risk, and make data-driven decisions. The dashboard highlights key metrics such as total loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, average interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios. It also breaks down loans by purpose, grade, home ownership status, and verification status, offering actionable insights into loan distribution, repayment trends, and risk factors.

### DASHBOARD OVERVIEW:

The Bank Loan Report dashboard project using SQL and Tableau is designed to provide comprehensive insights into key metrics and trends related to bank loans and portfolio management. By leveraging interactive visualizations and data analysis techniques, this dashboard helps financial analysts, loan officers, and business leaders identify risk factors, monitor loan performance, and make data-driven decisions.

These visualizations offer a detailed view of how loans are distributed and performing across various dimensions, including grade, purpose, verification status, and home ownership. Additionally, interactive filters enable users to drill down into specific loan categories and track month-to-date (MTD) performance, allowing for a more granular analysis of loan portfolios.

By focusing on areas such as charged-off loans, late payments, and fully paid loans, the dashboard provides critical insights into overall risk and repayment behavior. This enables financial institutions to identify high-risk segments, optimize their loan offerings, and improve the efficiency of their portfolio management strategies.
